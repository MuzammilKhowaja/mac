Mac os in your browser lol. you kinda need shellngn free trial and a chrome remote desktop account (if you want useable speeds) 
fork this
go to settings (make a ngrok account before this)
go to secrets and add a actions secret name NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN and put your authtoken in the other one
run it
user is Alone pass is Alone215
paste the host as a vnc
connect and you have it (should probably connect remote desktop)
